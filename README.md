Most of my personal projects are in-house business software for my side business selling moral patches. [ChimeranArt.com](https://www.chimeranart.com) If you find my projects useful, you can also help show support through [buymeacoffee.com](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cbowenjr).

My go to stack lately has been React, Tauri, and either Postgres or SQLite.
